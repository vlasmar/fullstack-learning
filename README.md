# fullstack-learning

That's my journey of learning MERN Full Stack Web Development! 
For over 7 years, I worked professionally in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and CMS such as Joomla and WordPress. 
However, in 2022, I took a four-month online course on web development and became enthusiastic about the idea of creating a website or application from scratch.
Then, for personal reasons, I took a two-year break, and now I have decided to refresh my knowledge and continue doing what I am passionate about.
